Welcome to **_EdVenturers'_** group project, GeoKnight. 
The school system failed, and it's up to you with your wealth of geographic knowledge to fend off the hordes to protect the world!

**GeoKnight** is a round-based game, where the user has to answer questions to boost their stats to fight off the enemy invaders. Stats can be boosted by choosing one of three categories in which, if answered correctly, grants you an increase to that respective stat.
You can also store your score at the end of each game!
